# python-transcribe-fs

code

## How to use?

Edit main.py to prob replace the huggingface token if it is dead lol

Clone the repo

run `docker compose up --build -d`

Put the files you want to transcribe in the `input` folder

And the transcriptions will come in the out folder if you have enough patience.

I reccomend combining this with syncthing to sync the callrecordings to input and sync out to whereever you want :)

## License

do whatever the fuck you want with this code lol
